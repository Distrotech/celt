The celt codec design and implementation have been merged into
the IETF Codec Working Group's "Opus" codec. As such, this
repository is no longer under active development.

Please see https://git.xiph.org/?p=opus.git
and https://git.xiph.org/?p=users/jm/opus-tools.git for more
current work. Visit http://opus-codec.org/ for more
information.

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
